# Bielinski-Portfolio

## Description

This project is a rework of my old portfolio. I was not happy with my old portfolio and wanted to create a new place to show off my work. I wanted to test my creativity and my capabilities in CSS and React. In this project, I challenged myself to leave my comfort zone, and experiment with React and CSS animations. I have learned a lot from this project, through debugging and thinking outside of the box.
